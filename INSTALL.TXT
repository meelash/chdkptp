Binaries for some platforms are available from the assembla files area
https://www.assembla.com/spaces/chdkptp/documents

*NOTE*: Google chrome may block the windows binary zip as malware, because
Google has decided that any unknown, unsigned exe *is* malware. If you want
to use chdkptp, view all downloads and "recover" the file (ignoring the
bullshit message that program "will harm your computer") or use a different
browser. Or if you don't trust me (and why should you?) build from source.

There is no installer, just unzip the file wherever you want.

h2. Windows

You must install a libusb-win32 driver to connect to cameras.

Zadig is the recommended way to install the libusb-win32 driver.
To install using this tool:

* Download the appropriate file for your OS from http://zadig.akeo.ie/
* Connect the camera
 * If you have never connected the camera before, wait for windows to install
   the default driver. 
* Run the zadig program
* Select "List all devices" in the options menu
* Select your camera in the dropdown. It will probably appear as "Canon Digital Camera".
 * If you have multiple Canon cameras, make sure only one is connected and powered on.
 * You can edit the name to allow identifying the driver later.
 * Be sure you have the camera selected. If you select the wrong device, the
   device you selected may become unusable until you remove the driver. The
   first item in the Driver link should be something referring to Mtp, 
   (e.g. WUDFWpdMtp on windows 10.) The first part of the USB ID will be 04A9
   for a Canon camera, and the second part will be the PID of your camera. 
* Select libusb-win32 in the driver option.
* click "Reinstall driver"
* Restart the camera before attempting to access it with a CHDK client. There
  is no need to restart your PC. 

See http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/PTP_Extension for additional information

After the driver is configured, simply run the executable. If you double click
on the .exe, the GUI will start. If you want to start the cli, run chdkptp -i

Note that installing the libusb driver normally prevents standard windows
software from connecting to the camera. To restore normal windows access, use
Zadig or windows device manager to remove the libusb driver.

h2. Linux

If a binary for your particular flavor of Linux is not available, you must build
from source. Some instructions can be found in README.TXT

The linux binary packages include executable files with and without GUI support.
Use the included chdkptp.sh to start the CLI-only build, or chdkptp_gui.sh to
start the GUI enabled executable.

These scripts should set all necessary environment variables.

The Linux packages include a minimal set of IUP and CD libraries for the GUI
executables. 

h3. Environment

On Linux, it is necessary to set some environment variables to allow chdkptp
to find the required lua files and shared libraries. This should be done
automatically by the scripts in the binary packages, but if you build
chdkptp yourself or wish to use different libraries, you may need to
adjust the values.

chdkptp.sh and chdkppt_gui.sh in the zip provide an examples.
* CHDKPTP_DIR should be set to the path where the chdkptp binary is located
* If you are using a GUI build and the IUP and CD libraries are not on your
  default LD_LIBRARY_PATH, add them to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
* If you have both GUI and non-GUI executables, set CHDKPTP_EXE
  to the desired executable.

h3. Interactions with default software 

On Linux, default camera software may connect to the camera automatically.
The details will depend on the Linux distribution and configuration, but a
common symptom is that the camera screen will go black when the camera is
plugged in, and chdkptp will be unable to switch the camera to record mode.
Note that this problem involves a state change on the camera, so once the
camera has entered the black screen state, chdkptp will be unable to switch
to record mode, even if software that triggered the change has been closed
or the camera "unmounted" in the UI.

In general, most modern distros use
https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev/udev.html
to handle hot plugged USB devices. For PTP capable devices this will often
invoke some kind of auto mount, which will often put the camera in the state
described above where it cannot be fully controlled by chdkptp.

h3. Permissions issues

In some configurations, the camera will only be accessible to the root user by
default. udev is generally used to control permissions on hot plugged devices.
